# Core Logging App

This core logging app was created back in 2015-2016. It is a fit-to-purpose tool that was deployed
to replace paper and having several spreadsheets. It also helped to streamline the drilling database
compilation. Before having the app deployed on site, the data was sent to a different office where
the data was typed and months later sent back to the site to be used in the modelling software.

The GUI serves as to data entry purposes. The information is saved in a SQLite Database. 

In addition to saving time, and adding productivity, also saved the site a certain amount of money
(cost no estimated) since no need to pay for software was needed. To date, after 6 years the tools
is still being used.

Final borehole coordinates can be entered into this window and some other useful data to have like
drilling company, coordinates and coordinates system.

Fit to purpose window for rock type, color and structures data captures. Back in the time when the app was designed 
the rationale to have the sampling in the same window was to delimiate the samples for each different rock
type.
