# Core Logging App

This core logging app was created back in 2015-2016. It is a fit-to-purpose tool that was deployed
to replace paper and having several spreadsheets. It also helped to streamline the drilling database
compilation. Before having the app deployed on site, the data was sent to a different office where
the data was typed and months later sent back to the site to be used in the modelling software.

In addition to saving time, and adding productivity, also saved the site a certain amount of money
(cost no estimated) since no need to pay for software was needed. To date, after 6 years the tools
is still being used.
